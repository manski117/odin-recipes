    <h3>This is what a burger looks like...we swear ;)</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients needed:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>buns</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
        <li>ground beef</li>
        <li>bacon</li>
        <li>katchup</li>
        <li>mustard</li>
        <li>mayonaise</li>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>montreal steak seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First begin by washing your hands and rolling up the ground beef into little balls about the size of your fist. Then smoosh them gently into flat patties. Continue to press firmly on them until they retain their shape as compact, saucer-shaped meat patties.</li>
        <li>Next, fry the patties on medium-high heat. Cast iron skillet prefered but not mandatory. As burgers brown, sprinkle them with montreal steak seasoning to give them a bit more kick.</li>
        <li>When blood can visibly be seen percolating from the meat patties, flip them over and fry for another 2-3 minutes until blood appears on this side. Then take off heat. This will ensure that you get some nice, medium rare patties that are delicious!</li>
        <li>While patties are still hot, add cheese. This will help the cheese melt into the beef and help it to taste extra good.</li>
        <li>While burgers are cooking, fry up .5lbs of bacon on the back-burner on high heat. Flip after 3-5 minutes. Remove bacon when it appears red and slightly browned for maximum crunchiness.</li>
        <li>You are almost ready to serve! Now lay out your buns, lettuce, condiments, bacon, and plates for your guests.</li>
        <li>Allow guests to put together their burgers themselves using the ingredients on the serving table. This way they can each customize their own sandwhich to their individual tastes. If they do not like cheese, ask them politely but firmly to leave.</li>
    </ol>
